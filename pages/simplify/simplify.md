## Why simple matters

### Noise kills signal

When you have an objective, all information is either signal or noise. In a world full of stimulations clamoring for our attention, we hunt for signal brutally and without attention span. Think of your user as a diner in a crowded restaurant. How many options are on your menu? What have you baffled to quiet the noise? Simplifying your app means embracing the short attention spans of busy people and understanding that they have better things to do with their lives than squint.

### Users fear complexity

Users are not confident in their ability to understand. If they detect that your app is complicated, they will leave if they can, and dispair if they cannot. An impression of simplicity reassures users that they are capable of understanding what you have to say. You have about five seconds to make this impression

## How to simplify

These are practical tips

### Write less

#### Avoid introductions

You may be tempted to prepare users, or greet them, or describe in words why users should care. Don't. Get straight to the core message.

#### Visualize

### Remove labels

#### Good information describes itself

#### Use context

#### Use visual cues

#### Use progressive disclosure

### Remove colors

Colors should...

- Encourage action
- Highlight differences
- Establish a brand

### Reduce font variations

- Exhaust all options before introducing another weight or font size

### Simplify borders, shadows

- Overuse undermines simplicity
- Whitespace looks simpler

(jira as example)

### Simplify layouts

- Don’t cram everything in the first screenfull
- Information scent
- Prefer one-dimensional layouts

## When simple fails

### You didn’t test the app

### It’s not intuitive

### You don’t know what’s important
